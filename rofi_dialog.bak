# This is a hack to get the rofi run dialog to execute things in the terminal
#+when launched from sxhkd.
# If launched directly fron sxhkd the -run-shell-command argument doesn't work.
# This command is also too big and ugly to fit in the sxhkdrc file.

# Variables
# $1 : Show what? Used in command below.
